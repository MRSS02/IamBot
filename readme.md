### Observation: The music functionality doesn't really work anymore. Also, this bot is a mess, i'm creating another one.

To set the bot on, put the token in a file named "token" in the "data" directory; or you could set the environment variable TOKEN as the token of your bot instead. 

The way the bot currently works, you'll need to connect the bot to a MongoDB database in order to be able to store and access certain data. For that, either put your database authentication token in a file named "dblogin" in that same "data" directory, or you could set the environment variable DBLOGIN as the authentication token of your database
